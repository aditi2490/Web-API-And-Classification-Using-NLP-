180cm
Plump build
Not fast but not slow either
Prefers to pass
Not a good dribbler
Not particular aggressive unless motivated to

For example if you’re a boy in England, you’re almost expected to play football, there are loads of teams and fierce competition.
With girls that’s not really the same, if you’re good with the ball you stand out because others are not likely to be ( from personal experience). It’s also incredibly hard to find a team that has enough players, hard to get scouts at games and if you don’t live near a city there will not be any profesional academy for you to get into.
So my point is do you guys think there is a drastic difference between the chances? To be honest I think there is, the male football environment is like a dog eat dog world and with women the competition is way less, having said that the opportunities you get are massively  lacking. Another example is I was offered a first team trial at West Brom ladies just by sending an email, I feel like this would almost certainly not happen in the male football system",football,Would you say it’s harder for a man to go pro than a woman?,https://www.reddit.com/r/football/comments/xzilgw/would_you_say_its_harder_for_a_man_to_go_pro_than/,True,submission

Some of the teams that did not qualify: 
South America - Venezuela, Bolivia, Colombia, Peru, Chile, Paraguay
Europe - Italy, Sweden, Austria, Rep. Ireland, Greece, Bosnia, Israel, Slovakia, Slovenia, Romania, Norway, Scotland, Ukraine, Turkey, Czech, North Macedonia,

I think European teams who don't finish first should do playoffs against other continental teams so it would give the rest of the world better chances to qualify. There's at least 4 teams in Africa who could easily beat 4 teams from Europe who qualified.

And i also think CONCACAF and CONMEBOL should be combined for WC qualifying. The US barely qualifies because it has to beat impoverished islands.
